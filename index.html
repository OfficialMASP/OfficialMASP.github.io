        <h2>Why Predict Alzheimer's Disease?</h2>
        <p class="lead">This is a great place to initially find out about your situation relating to Alzheimer's
          disease. This system will use an array of highly precise AI models to best possibly answer whether or not you
          have Alzheimer's. The system was trained on <a
            href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsdincer/alzheimer-features?select=alzheimer.csv"> this Kaggle
            dataset.</a> The system takes inputs about your demographics and brain features (age, estimated total intracranial volume, atlas scaling factor, etc.) and outputs that you
          either have Alzheimer's or do not. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <p class="lead"> <br>Alzheimer's disease is a progressive disease in which brain cell connections and the cells
          themselves degenerate and die, eventually destroying memory and other important mental functions. Memory loss
          and confusion are the main symptoms. No cure exists, but medications and management strategies may temporarily
          improve symptoms. <u>When Alzheimer's is diagnosed early on, treatments are more likely to be effective! </u>
          <br><br>Some notable statistics about
          Alzheimer's disease:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>More than 6 million Americans of all ages have Alzheimer's. </li>
          <li>About 1 in 9 people age 65 and older has Alzheimer's.</li>
          <li>Almost 2 out of 3 Americans with Alzheimer's are women.</li>
          <li>Deaths from Alzheimer’s have more than doubled between 2000 and 2019.</li>

            have a lower value and still be diagnosed with the disease. On the other hand, any person that has a CDR

            predict whether a patient has Alzheimer's disease or not. The closer a number is to 1, the more closely
            related the two variables that made that number are. On the other hand, the opposite effect happens the
            closer a number is to -1. The audience should pay special attention to the 'Outcome' variable, which is the
            one that says whether a patient has Alzheimer's disease or not. Clinical dementia rating (CDR) and mini
            mental state examination (MMSE) seem to be the most influential features on whether or not a person has
            Alzheimer's.</h5>

          <u><h5>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):</h5></u>
          <h6>How It Works</h6>
        <p> KNN works by finding the distances between a new data point and old data
          points. Depending on what the closest old data points are classified as, the new point will get classified
          accordingly. The amount of old data points it will look at depends on the specified number K. This model had a
          64% accuracy. </p>

          <u><h5>Support Vector Classifiers (SVC):</h5></u>
          <h6>How It Works</h6>
          <p>SVC maps the data to a higher dimensional space and then finds
          the optimal hyperplane that has the highest margins between the data points and the hyperplane. This model
          had a 98% accuracy.</p>

          <u><h5>Random Forest Classifier (RFC):</h5></u>
          <h6>How It Works</h6>
          <p>RFC creates a randomly generated number of datasets that vary in size. It creates a decision tree from each new dataset. It then collects votes from each decision tree for
          which category the new data point should belong in. Whatever category has the most votes, the data point
        gets placed in that category. This model had a 100% accuracy.              </p>

          <u><h5>Logistic Regression Classifier (LRC):</h5></u>
          <h6>How It Works</h6>
          <p>LRC makes predictions based on the Sigmoid function which is a
          squiggles-like line. Despite the fact that it returns the probabilities, the final output would be a label
          assigned by comparing the likelihood with a threshold, which makes it eventually a classification algorithm.

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p class="lead">We were not expecting our models to be so accurate when predicting whether or not a person had
          Alzheimer's based on our training data. We were pleasantly surprised to see such high accuracies, and further
          hyperparameter tuning for these models ensured that our models were more generally applicable to other data.
          RFC ended up being our best machine learning model for this classification system, so we ended up using that model for the backend of our Alzheimer's Prediction Form. However, the fact that SVC and
          LRC were nearly just as accurate was interesting. Perhaps because our dataset was small (only 317 instances to
          train and test on), these models ended up being highly accurate. Demographic and brain
          features (such as estimated total intracranial volume and normalize whole brain volume) prove to be highly
          effective in determining whether people have Alzheimer's disease. <br><br> Such AI detection systems are easy
          to use and can help patients seek treatments early -- before Alzheimer's disease causes serious harm.
